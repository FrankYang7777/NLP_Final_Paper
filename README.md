# Analyzing and Classifying COVID-19 News Using TF-IDF

This Jupyter notebook explores the application of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to analyze and classify news articles about COVID-19 as real or fake. During the pandemic, the spread of misinformation has been rampant. This project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) to tackle this issue, providing a method to sift through the noise and identify reliable information.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a 'pandemic of misinformation'. This notebook addresses the challenge of identifying and classifying misinformation using advanced NLP techniques. We focus on using TF-IDF, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Analysis**: Implementation of TF-IDF to highlight significant features in texts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Comparison of models like XGBoost and SVM to classify news effectively.
- **Linguistic Feature Analysis**: Enhanced analysis of the linguistic features that determine the model's judgment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study was taken from the kaggle web-site and its original purpose was to serve as a subtask for CON-STRAINT-2021. This data was obtained from several different social media including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. The dataset is split into two parts. The first one is the train set and the second one is testing set. The dataset is divided into three columns, which are id, tweet and label, where id is the news id (primary key), tweet is the content of the news and label is the classification of the news (fake or real). Considering that each news item has been labeled, this dataset can be used for this study. According to the description of the data source, the train set as well as the test set of the dataset are random sampling, so no further resampling is needed. 

## Code Using
### Implementation of TF-IDF
The notebook begins with an implementation of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. TF-IDF is utilized to quantify the importance of words in each document within the corpus of COVID-19 news articles. This is achieved by considering not only how frequently a term appears in a single document but also how often it occurs across all documents, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.

The TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn is employed to convert the raw text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features. Before applying the vectorizer, the text data undergoes preprocessing which includes tokenization, removal of stopwords, and normalization to lower case. This preprocessing step is crucial as it cleans the data and ensures that the TF-IDF calculations are meaningful and accurate.

### Machine Learning Models for Classification

notebook transitions into the modeling phase. Five machine learning models, Naive Beyes, NN, Random Forest, XGBoost and SVM (Support Vector Machine), are explored to classify the news articles into 'real' or 'fake' categories. The choice of these models is backed by literature indicating their effectiveness in text classification tasks.

## Feature Importance Analysis
A notable aspect of the notebook is its focus on analyzing the significant features (words) identified by the TF-IDF vectorization in relation to their impact on the classification results. By examining the feature importances and weights assigned by the models, particularly the SVM, the notebook provides insights into which words are most influential in determining whether news is classified as real or fake. This analysis is vital for understanding the underlying patterns in the data that the models are leveraging to make decisions.

This detailed code overview showcases the strategic application of NLP techniques and machine learning models to address a real-world problem of misinformation, particularly during critical times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The notebook not only applies these techniques but also provides a thorough examination of their effectiveness and the linguistic characteristics they reveal.

## Model Evaluation and Analysis
For each model, the notebook conducts a detailed performance analysis using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the models in classifying news accurately. Additionally, confusion matrices are generated to visualize the performance and understand the behavior of the models concerning false positives and false negatives.
