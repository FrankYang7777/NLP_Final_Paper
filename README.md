# Analyzing and Classifying COVID-19 News Using TF-IDF

This Jupyter notebook explores the application of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to analyze and classify news articles about COVID-19 as real or fake. During the pandemic, the spread of misinformation has been rampant. This project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) to tackle this issue, providing a method to sift through the noise and identify reliable information.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a 'pandemic of misinformation'. This notebook addresses the challenge of identifying and classifying misinformation using advanced NLP techniques. We focus on using TF-IDF, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Analysis**: Implementation of TF-IDF to highlight significant features in texts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Comparison of models like XGBoost and SVM to classify news effectively.
- **Linguistic Feature Analysis**: Enhanced analysis of the linguistic features that determine the model's judgment.
